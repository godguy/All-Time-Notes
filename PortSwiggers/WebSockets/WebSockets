--->What Are WebSockets?
→ WebSockets are a bi-directional, full duplex communications protocol initiated over HTTP. They are commonly used in modern web applications for streaming data and other asynchronous traffic.

--->Difference Between HTTP And WebSockets
→ WebSockets Are Initiated over http and are typically long lived
→ Connection will stay online until the client or server is ready to send a message 
→ WebSockets are particularly useful in situations where low-latency or server-initiated messages are required, such as real-time feeds of financial data.

--->How WebSockets establish Connections?
→WebSocket connections are normally created using client-side JavaScript like the following:
 var ws = new WebSocket("wss://normal-website.com/chat");
 
 #wss protocol establishes a WebSocket over an encrypted TLS connection, whereas the ws protocol uses an unencrypted connection

→ The Connection And Upgrade headers in the request and response indicate that this is a WebSocket Handshake.
→ The Sec-WebSocket-Version request header specifies the WebSocket protocol version that the client wishes to use. This is typically 13.
→ The Sec-WebSocket-Key Request Header contains a Base64-encoded random value submitted in the Sec-WebSocket-Key request Header, Concatenated with a specific string defined in the protocol specification. This is done to prevent misleading response resulting from misconfigured servers or caching proxies.

#In Common WebApps , It is Common for JSON to be used to send structured data with WebSocket Messages.
