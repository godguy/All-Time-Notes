SMB:    
    It stands for server message block. SMB operates as an application layer networking protocol mainly used for providing 
    shared access to files, printers, and serial ports and miscellaneous communication between nodes on a network. It also
    provides an authenticated inter-process communication mechanism.

NetBIOS:
    It Stands for Network Basic Input/Output System.
    It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to
        communicate over a local area network.
    The SMB NetBIOS service listens on tcp ports 139 and 445. as well as several UDP ports. These can be scanned with tools
        such as Nmap, nbtscan.

Null Session Enumeration:
    A null session is refers to a unauthenticated NetBIOS session between 2 computers.
    This feature exists to  allow unauthenticated machines to obtain browser lists from other Microsoft servers. As null
        session also allows unauthenticated hackers to obtain large amounts of information about the machine, such as password
        policies, usernames, group names, machine names, user and host SIDs.

Nmap:
    Nmap contains many useful NSE scripts that can be used to discover and enumerate SMB services
     SMB Nmap NSE scripts location: ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*
