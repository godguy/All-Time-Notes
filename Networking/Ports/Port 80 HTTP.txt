Hyper Text Transfer Protocol:
    Foundation for data communication for www(World Wide Web)
    The HTTP standard defines the following request methods:GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, 
        TRACE, CONNECT,  and OPTIONS(PATCH was also proposed but not commonly implemented in 
        the  HTTP  RFC).  At  the  time  of  this  writing,  browsers  willonly  send GET 
        and POST  requests  using  HTML.  
        Any PUT,PATCH, or DELETE request is the result of JavaScriptâ€™s invoking the  HTTP request.
        This  will  have  implications  later  in  the book when we consider vulnerability
        examples in applications expecting these method types.
