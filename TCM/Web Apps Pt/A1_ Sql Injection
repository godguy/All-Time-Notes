Sql injection is an attack malicious SQL statements are injected into SQL database.
SQL injections is easy to avoid, but still happens very often maybe because of poor code.
If successful, we can read sensitive databases, extract information, and potentially a shell.

COMMON SQL VERBS:
    sql statements begins with verbs.
        SELECT: Retrieves data from a table.
        INSERT: Adds data to a server.
        DELETE: Removes data from a data.
        UPDATE: Modifies data in a table.
        DROP:   Deletes a table.
        UNION:  Combines data from multiple queries.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
    Important Special Characters:
        ' and " ------- Are String Delimiters.
        --, /* and # -- Are Comment Delimiters
        * and % ------- Are Wildcards.
        ; ------------- End SQL Statements.
        = + <> () etc - Bunch Of Others That Follow Programmatic Logic.

DEFENCES AGAINST SQL INJECTION:
    Defence 1: Parameterized Statements:
        Example 1: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email =?";
        Example 2: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email ='''+email+'''";
    
    Defence 2: Sanitizing Input
