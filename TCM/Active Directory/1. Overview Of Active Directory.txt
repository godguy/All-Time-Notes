what is Active Directory?
    Domain service developed by Microsoft to manage windows domain
        networks. 

    Stores information related to objects, such as Computers, Users, Printers etc.
        Think about it as a phone book for windows.

    Authentication using kerbeos ticket.
        Non-Windows devices, such as Linux machines, firewalls etc
            can also authenticate to active directory via RADIUS or LDAP.

Why Active Directory?
    Active directory is most commonly used identity management service in the world.
    95% of the 1000 companies implemented this service in their network.
    Can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits.
        Instead we abuse trust, features, components and more.

Physical Active Directory Components:
    1. Domain Controllers:
        -> Hosts a copy of AD DS directory store.
        -> Provides authenticate and authorization services.
        -> Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain or forest.
        -> Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources.

    2. Active Directory DS Data Stores: Contains database files and processes that store and manage directory 
        information for user service and applications.
            -> Consists of Ntds.dit file.(Ntds.dit contains everything stored in AD data, like: User, objects, groups, password hashes etc of that domain)
            -> Is stored by default in the %SYSTEMROOT%\NTDS folder on all domain controllers.
            -> Is accessible only through the domain controller process and protocols.

    3. Logical AD Components:
        AD DS Schema:(Kind Of Rule Book)
            -> Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory.
            -> Enforce rules regarding object creation and configuration.
        Domains: Domains are used to group and manage objects in an organization.
            -> An administrative boundary for applying policies to groups of objects.
            -> A replication boundary to replicate data between domain controllers.
            -> An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resource.
    
    4. Trees: A domain tree is hierarchy of domain in AD DS.
            -> Share a contiguous namespace with parent domain. ({goodguy.com} is a parent domain whereas {members.goodguy.com} is a child domain and all these domains create a tree)
            -> Can have additional child domains.
            -> By default create a two-way transitive trust with other domains.
    
    5.Forest: A forest is a collection of 1 or more domain trees.
            -> Shares a common schema.
            -> Share a common configuration partition.
            -> Share a common global catalog to enable searching.
            -> Enables trust between all domains in forest.
            -> Share the enterprise admins and schema admins groups.
    
    6. Organizational Units(OU's): OU's are active directory containers that can contain users, groups, computers,
        and other OU's.
            -> Represents your organization hierarchically and logically.
            -> Manage a collection of objects in consistent way.
            -> Delegate permission to administer groups of objects.
            -> Apply policies.
    
    7. Trusts: Trust provide a mechanism to grant access to resources in other domains.
            -> Directional Trust: The trust direction flows from trusting domains to trusted domains.
            -> Transitive Domains: The trust is extended beyond a 2 domain trust to include other trusted domains.
            -> All Domains in the forest trust all other domains in the forest.
            -> Trusts can extend outside the forest.
            
    8. Objects:
            -> User: Enables network resource access to user.
            -> InetOrgPerson: 1. Similar to a user account. 2. Used for compatibility with other directory services.
            -> Contacts: Used Primarily used to assign e-mail address to external users
            -> Groups: Used to simplify the administration of access control.
            -> Computers: Enables authentication and auditing of computer access to resource.
            -> Printers: used to simplify the process of locating and connecting to printers.
            -> Shared Folders: Enables users to search for shared folders based on properties.
