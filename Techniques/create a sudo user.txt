How to Create a New User with sudo Permission in Kali Linux?

First, Right click on the Desktop, and then click on 'Open in Terminal' to Open Terminal. After that, follow the steps below:-

 Step 1: Create a New Normal User by command below:-

         useradd -m testuser

         #-m creates a home directory for the user.


 Step 2: Set password for the user:-

         passwd testuser


 Step 3: Now, Add user to sudo group (This allows user to install software, use the printer etc.)

         usermod -a -G sudo testuser

         # -a means add

         #-G sudo means to add the user to sudoers group


 Step 4: Now, we have to specify the shell for our new user.

         chsh -s /bin/bash testuser

        # chsh means change login shell

        #  -s means, it is the name of the shell you want for the user, in this case /bin/bash


It's done
