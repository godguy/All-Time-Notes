Bash Configuration Files?
    Configuration Files Which are loaded before executing your bash scripts.

There are 4 Main Configuration Files:

    1. .bash_profile:

            .bash_profile is designed to execute when a user login. .bash_profile is different for every user
            on a system.
    
    2. .bashrc:
        This File Executes right before the command prompt comes up or it runs when you start a new bash instance by
            typing bash in a shell.
    
    3. .bash_history:
        This file simply is what you have typed as this particular user in the shell.
