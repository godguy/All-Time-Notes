The Shell:
    Shell (or command line interpreter) began with first unix shell back in 1971, called the V6 Shell. Written by
        Ken Thompson from Bell Labs, this shell (simply the /bin/sh) was a user program that executed from outside of
        the kernal.

    Many of the things we have come to expect from bash were added after the initial shell's development (Like Globbing
        for parameter or the 'if' command for conditional evaluation). But it introduce many of the common aspects of our
        current shell(including Bash) like redirection and piping as well as sequential and asynchronous comm anands.

    In 1977, the Bourne Shell was introduced having been created by stephen bourne while at Bell Labs for V7 unix.
        The Bourne Shell itself was written with one of the main goals being to support interactive execution of
        commands for operating system, thus scripting was born :)  .

    The BourneShell introduced more advanced concepts in the shell and scripting capabilities such as control
        structure (if, while, case) as well as signal handling and command execution.
    
    These shells gave birth to a large number of shells we have all heard of Korn, Almquish, Cshell, and eventually
        The Bourne Again Shell(Which We Refer to as bash).
    

The Bourne Again Shell(Bash):
    This is an open source (GNU) project that was intended to completely replace the Bourne Shell. It was developed
        by Brain Fox and has become the standard shell for almost all linux distributions over time.

    Bash does incorporates full compatibility with the previous Bourne Shell as well as the incorporations of
        features from from Kron and C Shell.

    In addition to the basic scripting that has always been a part of bourne, Bash provides the ability to define functions,
        include regular expression and associative array among other advanced features.

    Bash is also released under GLP rather than BSD Licenses.
