What Is A Virus:
    A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself
        by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. When this 
        replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with
        a computer virus. Virus require a user action i order to reproduce and spread.

Types Of Virus: 
    1. Boot Sector: These virus are stored in the first sector of a hard drive and are loaded
        into memory upon boot. Very hard to detect because it installs during the booting of the
        system. system's antivirus only starts after the booting of the system. To detect these kind
        of viruses use antivirus which looks specifically looks for boot sector viruses. Modern
        3rd party antivirus are capable enough nowadays.
 
    2. Macro: Virus embedded into a document and is executed when the document is opened by the
        users.

    3. programs: infect a executable or application.
    
    4. Multipartite: This virus combines with boot and programs virus to first attach itself
        to the boot sector and system files before attacking other files on the computer.
    
    5. Encrypted: This virus uses cypher to encrypt the contents of itself to avoid detection from
        any antivirus software.
    
    6. Polymorphic: Advanced version of encrypted virus that changes itself every time it is
        executed by altering the decryption module to avoid detection.
    
    7. Metamorphic: Virus which is able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect
        a file.(Advanced Version of Polymorphic Virus)
    
    8. Stealth: Technique by which virus protects itself. Uses Encryption, Metamorphic and
        Polymorphic techniques.
    
    9. Armored: Armored virus have a layer of protection to confuse a programmer or person
        analyzing it.
    
    10. Hoax:   Not a virus, Social Engineering technique.
