IDS -> Intrusion Detection Systems:
    Devices or software applications that maintain a system or network and analyzes the data passing through it in
        order to identify an incident or attack.
    
    2 Types Of IDS:
        1. HIDS(Host Based IDS):
            Software installed on a system or server & will log everything on a system identify the suspicious things
                or programs.
        
        2. NIDS(Network Based IDS):
            Hardware installed in a network and all the traffic goes through switch will be copied and sent to the
                NIDS will log if something suspicious & alert on it.

How IDS Detect Intrusion:
    3 Ways Of Detection:
        -> Signature-Based: A specific string of bytes of string triggers an alert.
            This Method will search for a specific string of bytes which trigger an alert.
        
        -> Policy-Based: Relies on specific declaration of the security policy. (i.e. No Telnet Authorization)

        -> Anomaly-Based: Analyzes the current traffic against an established baseline and triggers an alert if
            outside the statistical average.

4 Types of alerts:
    1. True Positive: Malicious Activity is identified as an attack.
    2. True Negative: Legitimate activity is identified a legitimate activity.
    3. False Positive: Legitimate Activity is identified as an attack.
    4. False Negative: Malicious Activity is identified an legitimate attack.
    
    -> IDS can only alert and log suspicious activity.
    -> IPS(Intrusion Prevention System) can also stop malicious activity fromm being executed.
    -> HIDS logs are used to recrate the events after an attack as occurred.
