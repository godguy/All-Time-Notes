Removable Media Controls:
    Technical limitations placed on a system in regards to the utilization of usb storage devices and other removable media.
        -> Always encrypt files on removable media.

NAS(Network Attached Storage):
    Storage devices that are connected directly to your organization's network.
        -> NAS systems often implement RAID arrays to ensure high availability.

SAN(Storage Area Network):
    Network designed specifically to perform block storage functions that may consist of NAS devices.
        -> NAS Tips:
            --> Use Data Encryption.
            --> Use Proper Authentication.
            --> Log NAS Access.

Disk Encryption:
    Encryption scrambles data into unscrambled information.

    2 Types of Encryption:
        -> Self Encrypting Devices(SED):
            Storage devices that perform whole disk encryption by using embedded hardware.
        
        -> Software Based Encryption:
            Encrypting data with a help of tools:
                --> Mac: File Vailt
                --> Windows: Bit Locker

    -> TPM(Trusted Platform Module):
        Chip residing on the motherboard that contain an encryption key.

        If your motherboard doesn't have TPM, You can use an external usb drive as a key.
    
    AES(Advanced Encryption Standards):
        Used by both windows bit-locker and macOs file-vault. It is a symmetric key encryption that supports 128bit
            and 256 bit key's. Encryption adds security but has lower performance.
    
    HSM(Hardware Security Module):
        Physical devices that act as a secure crypto-processor during the encryption process.(Hardware Based Encryption)
